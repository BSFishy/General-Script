# General Script
General Script is a language based on extensibility. Most everything in the language is changeable or modifiable using a well documented API.

## The Idea
The idea of General Script is to give anyone the tools to create a language for whatever they need, whether it is a game, program, or anything else.

## Warning
General Script is still in an early stage. Most things will not work, and may not be documented. Use at your own risk.
